# Two-Dice Pig Game

Here's a brief description of how to play the game:

- The game is played by two players or against the computer, and each turn consists of a player rolling two six-sided dice.

- The player's score for that turn is the sum of the numbers rolled on the dice.

- The player can choose to roll again and add the new sum to their current score, or they can choose to end their turn and keep their current score.

- If the player rolls a one on either of the dice, their turn ends and their score for that turn is zero.

- If the player rolls a one on both of the dice, their turn ends and their entire score during that round will be lost.

- The first player to reach a predetermined winning score (100 points) wins the game.
